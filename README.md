## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of transaction data. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, anomaly detection, clustering, and time series forecasting. The project leverages various machine learning and deep learning techniques to achieve these tasks.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering using PCA, t-SNE, and Autoencoders
- Anomaly detection using One-class SVM and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Clustering using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
- Time series analysis using ARIMA and LSTM
- Graph-based analysis using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have R and the following R libraries installed:

- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `caret`
- `cluster`
- `kernlab`
- `factoextra`
- `forecast`
- `Rtsne`
- `dbscan`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "caret", "cluster", "kernlab", "factoextra", "forecast", "Rtsne", "dbscan"))
install.packages("tensorflow")
install.packages("keras")
